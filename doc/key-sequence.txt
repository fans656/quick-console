# Types of key sequence

There are several user point of view of key sequence:

- type in
    bring out the console, type in a command which consists of
    a series of characters, then press <enter> to execute the
    command
    (see below for an explanation for the keySeq after the "->")

    e.g. "yx" -> "{yx}<enter>$<enter>^"

- Ctrl modifier
    press "Ctrl + ;" to bring out the console, then release ";"
    while holding the Ctrl pressed, press a series of keys,
    when the series of keys match a predefined pattern, the
    command begin to execute and the console vanish

    e.g. "Ctrl+d" -> "<ctrl>d$d^<ctrl>^"
         "Ctrl+pi" -> "<ctrl>{pi}"

- char modifier
    bring out the console, then use a normal key such as "A"
    as a modifier and then type "J".
    This is just like the Ctrl modifier except that the modifier
    is not a traditional MODIFIER

    e.g. "a+j"

# Normalized key sequence

- key down
    "ab" -> "a down b down"
    char literal represents the key press which generate the char
    (case insensitive)

- key up
    "aa^" -> "a down a up"
    char literal append with a "^" represents the key release of
    which generate that char

- special key
    "<ctrl>"
    name enclosed in pair of "<>" represents special key

- callback position
    "$" is a place holder for a function to be called when that
    specific position is reached
